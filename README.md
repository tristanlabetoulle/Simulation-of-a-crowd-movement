# Presentation
This program aims at simulating a crowd movement at a macroscopic level for agent with different sizes. The movement of the agents is based on a navigation vector field computed thanks to the fast marching method. The program is simple and robust and can be easily used to see how a crowd evolves under stress ( the agents are colored according to their stress level ).

# Run the code
Launch the file Simulation to see an example of how to use it.

# Requirements
ffmpeg must be installed to save the simulation in a mp4 file
